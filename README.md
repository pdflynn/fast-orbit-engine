FOE: Fast Orbit Engine

A simple satellite orbit propagator and visulaization tool using 6 Keplerian orbital elements. The goal is to be able to compute the positions of many satellites simultaneously (thus "fast" orbit engine).

Celestial bodies are assumed to be perfect spheres.

Might merge this into SLAM if I ever finish it / work more on the other project.
